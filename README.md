# Simon-Game
Recreated a game named as Simon game using basics of html, css and js. The game involves clicking a random key to start the game and the game continues as random colour flashes every time and we need to remember our pattern to keep increasing our levels, as soon as we click the wrong colour he game restarts and we get our score on the top.t
